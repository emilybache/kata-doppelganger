# Doppelganger

*Goal*: learn about the various types of test doubles

## Instructions

There are bugs in the code (marked with a `Bug!` comment), but all the
tests are passing.

For each test, you will find a `TODO` comment. Your job
is to implement a test double for each test, and to use it
to make the test fail for the right reason, i.e, triggering
the bugs. You must do so by **adding only test code** - you
are not allowed to change the production code.

Here's the order in which you should fix the test - they go from easiest to trickiest :)

1. SafeCalculator
1. DiscountApplier
1. MailSender

## Step 1 - without any library

For this step, you are not allowed to add any external library.

Make a commit when you're done fixing all the TODOs

## Step 2 - with a library

Use a library like `mockito` for Java, `unittest.mock` for Python or
`sinon` for JavaScript to rewrite all the tests.

Make a second commit so you can compare test code with step 1.

Which version do you prefer?
